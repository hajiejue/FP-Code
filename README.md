This FP is based on two well designed neural netwrok. The first paper called "Jointly Adversarial Enhancement Training for Robust End-to-End Speech Recognition" and its original paper can be found here: https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/pdfs/interspeech_2019/liu19_interspeech.pdf. The second paper called "SEGAN: Speech Enhancement Generative Adversarial Network" and its original paper can be found here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.09452.pdf
For the first paper, you shoul download the original code using following commands:
git clone https://github.com/bliunlpr/Robust_e2e_gan.git
After download the repo, you can running :
sh run.sh
